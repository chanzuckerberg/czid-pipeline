Developers
----------


When merging a commit to master, you need to increase the version number in `idseq_pipeline/version/__init__.py`:
  - if results are expected to change, increase the 2nd number
  - if results are not expected to change, increase the 3rd number.


Release notes
-------------

- 1.5.0
    - Identify hits that have poor affinity to a species but map well into their genus
      as "non species specific" hits.  Previously those hits were assigned arbitrary
      species within the genus.

- 1.4.0
    - Version result folder.

- 1.3.0
    - Fix bug causing alignment to run before host subtraction in samples
      with unpaired reads.
    - Include ERCC gene counts from STAR.

- 1.2.0
    - Synchronize pair order after STAR to improve sensitivity in 10% of
      samples with paired-end reads.
